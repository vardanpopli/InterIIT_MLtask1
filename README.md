Task: classifier utilizing the BERT transformer to discern the relationship between a given text pair and its corresponding reason. The process involved negative sampling for data augmentation through cosine similarity, and training the model. Metrics such as F1 score, recall, support, and precision were carefully examined and reported.

To enhance efficiency, hyperparameter tuning through grid search is done, refining the model's performance and optimizing its parameters for better accuracy in causal reasoning classification.
